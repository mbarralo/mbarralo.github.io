title:  JavaEE - Demo Templates
---

I just created two new templates to use for demo purposes.
Clone and modify as you wish!

## JSF Template

To kickstart any JSF Project to showcase Java EE features

This includes:

+ Java EE -> JSF
+ Bootstrap (Twitter)
+ Jquery

Already has some persistence data bootstraped and initiated on deployment.

This can be found in [javaee jsf demo](https://github.com/mbarralo/javaee-jsf-demo)

## REST Microservice Template

To kickstart any Restful Microservice Project to mock services or simply test stuff

This includes:

+ Java EE -> JAX-RS
+ Docker image setup

As the previous template, has some persistence data bootstraped and initiated on deployment.

This can be found in [javaee microservice](https://github.com/mbarralo/javaee-microservice)
